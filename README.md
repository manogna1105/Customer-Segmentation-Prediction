# Customer-Segmentation & Prediction

A Customer Segmentation and Prediction project involves dividing a customer base into distinct groups based on shared characteristics and behaviors, with the goal of understanding customer needs and predicting future actions. 

## Tools:

Machine learning algorithms like K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and decision trees can be used to identify and create segments. 

## Predictive Modeling:
### Purpose:

To predict future customer behavior, such as churn, purchase likelihood, and lifetime value. 

### Methods:
* Machine Learning: Techniques like logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests are used to build predictive models. 
* Statistical Analysis: Regression and correlation analysis can also be used to identify relationships between customer characteristics and future behavior.
  
### Benefits:
* Targeted Marketing: Personalized messages and offers can be sent to specific segments based on predicted behavior. 
* Churn Prediction: Identifying customers at risk of churn can help businesses implement retention strategies. 
* Inventory Optimization: Predicting future demand can help businesses optimize inventory levels. 
### Project Stages:
* Data Collection: Gathering customer data from various sources like CRM systems, website analytics, and surveys. 
* Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming data to prepare it for analysis and modeling. 
* Segmentation: Creating customer segments using machine learning or statistical methods. 
* Predictive Modeling: Building models to predict future customer behavior. 
* Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of segmentation and predictive models. 
* Implementation: Implementing the findings into business strategies and operations.
